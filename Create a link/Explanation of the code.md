##This script is written in Google Apps Script, specifically for use within Google Sheets. Here's an explanation of each function:

1. **createLinks()**: This function retrieves data from the "Slots" sheet in the active Google Spreadsheet. It loops through each cell in column C (assuming column C contains the criteria) and checks if the cell value is either "GTa" or "GTe". If it matches either of these values, it calls the `createLink()` function to create a hyperlink in the corresponding row in column A. The hyperlink is constructed based on the provided base URL and the ID retrieved from the same row in column B.

2. **createLink(sheet, row, baseUrl)**: This function is called by `createLinks()` to generate a hyperlink in a specific row of the provided sheet. It constructs the hyperlink URL by appending the ID retrieved from column B of the specified row to the base URL. It then sets the formula in the corresponding cell in column A to create the hyperlink using the `HYPERLINK()` function.

3. **setUpTrigger()**: This function sets up a time-driven trigger to run the `createLinks()` function every 24 hours. It uses the `ScriptApp` service to create a new trigger that calls the `createLinks()` function. The trigger is set to run every day (`everyDays(1)`).

Overall, this script automates the process of creating hyperlinks in column A of the "Slots" sheet based on certain criteria in column C. It also ensures that this process is executed daily through the use of a time-driven trigger.
